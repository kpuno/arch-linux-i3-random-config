the following configuration values:\n\n* `status-bar.cursorPositionFormat` \u0026mdash; A string that describes the format to use for the cursor position status bar tile. It defaults to `%L:%C`. In the format string, `%L` represents the 1-based line number and `%C` represents the 1-based column number.\n\n* `status-bar.selectionCountFormat` \u0026mdash; A string that describes the format to use for the selection count status bar tile. It defaults to `(%L, %C)`. In the format string, `%L` represents the 1-based line count and `%C` represents the 1-based character count.\n\n## API\n\nThis package provides a service that you can use in other Atom packages. To use it, include `status-bar` in the `consumedServices` section of your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-package\",\n  \"consumedServices\": {\n    \"status-bar\": {\n      \"versions\": {\n        \"^1.0.0\": \"consumeStatusBar\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, in your package's main module, call methods on the service:\n\n```coffee\nmodule.exports =\n  activate: -\u003e # ...\n\n  consumeStatusBar: (statusBar) -\u003e\n    @statusBarTile = statusBar.addLeftTile(item: myElement, priority: 100)\n\n  deactivate: -\u003e\n    # ...\n    @statusBarTile?.destroy()\n    @statusBarTile = null\n```\n\nThe `status-bar` API has four methods:\n\n  * `addLeftTile({ item, priority })` - Add a tile to the left side of the status bar. Lower priority tiles are placed further to the left.\n  * `addRightTile({ item, priority })` - Add a tile to the right side of the status bar. Lower priority tiles are placed further to the right.\n\nThe `item` parameter to these methods can be a DOM element, a [jQuery object](http://jquery.com), or a model object for which a view provider has been registered in the [the view registry](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/ViewRegistry).\n\n  * `getLeftTiles()` - Retrieve all of the tiles on the left side of the status bar.\n  * `getRightTiles()` - Retrieve all of the tiles on the right side of the status bar\n\nAll of these methods return `Tile` objects, which have the following methods:\n\n  * `getPriority()` - Retrieve the priority that was assigned to the `Tile` when it was created.\n  * `getItem()` - Retrieve the `Tile`'s item.\n  * `destroy()` - Remove the `Tile` from the status bar.\n","metadata":{"name":"status-bar","version":"1.4.1","main":"./lib/main","description":"Display information about the current editor such as cursor position, file path, grammar, current branch, ahead/behind commits counts, and line diff count.","repository":"https://github.com/atom/status-bar","license":"MIT","engines":{"atom":"*"},"dependencies":{"fs-plus":"^2.0.0","grim":"^1.0.0","underscore-plus":"^1.0.0"},"providedServices":{"status-bar":{"description":"A container for indicators at the bottom of the workspace","versions":{"1.0.0":"provideStatusBar","0.58.0":"legacyProvideStatusBar"}}},"configSchema":{"cursorPositionFormat":{"type":"string","default":"%L:%C","description":"Format for the cursor position status bar element, where %L is the line number and %C is the column number"},"selectionCountFormat":{"type":"string","default":"(%L, %C)","description":"Format for the selection count status bar element, where %L is the line count and %C is the character count"}},"devDependencies":{"atom-space-pen-views":"^2.0.0","coffeelint":"^1.9.7"}}}
